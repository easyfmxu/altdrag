{"name":"AltDrag","tagline":"Easily drag windows when pressing the alt key","body":"### AltDrag\r\nAltDrag gives you the ability to move and resize your windows in a new way. When running, you can simply keep the Alt key depressed and then click and drag any window. Besides just moving windows, you can resize, maximize and close them too. AltDrag simply allows you to do more with less mouse movements.\r\n\r\nThis behavior already exists in Linux and other operating systems, and AltDrag was made with the mission to copy that behavior to the Windows platform. I believe I have succeeded with this and also added a lot of new intuitive functionality that makes your everyday computing a little easier.\r\n\r\n- [Download installer](http://altdrag.googlecode.com/files/AltDrag-1.0.exe)\r\n- [Download 7-zip archive](http://altdrag.googlecode.com/files/AltDrag-1.0.7z)\r\n\r\n[View more projects from the author.](http://stefansundin.github.io/)\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n1.0 final - 2013-09-13:\r\n\r\n* Add `Lower` scroll wheel action. Scroll down to lower windows, up to raise windows, shift+down to minimize windows, shift+up to toggle maximized state.\r\n* Old `Lower` actions will now also minimize the window if you hold shift.\r\n* Updated most of the translations.\r\n","google":"UA-6797859-18","note":"Don't delete this file!
